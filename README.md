Introduction
------------
Harmful Algal Bloom (HAB) Watch is a listing of HAB events as reported by the community, state program volunteers, official offices, from historical events, or by other MERHAB projects. 

Our goal is to facilitate, improve, and inform: to facilitate current monitoring volunteers that weekly visit the California shorelines to protect the community, fisheries, and ecology; to improve the body of knowledge of HABs by using latest metrics, data visualization, and other technologies; and to inform the public to reduce human exposure to HABs.
